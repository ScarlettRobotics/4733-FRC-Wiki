Our group is made up of 4 sub-teams: Design, Electrical, Build and Code. In each sub-team you will learn various skills and methods to design, build, wire and code. Each sub-team has specific roles and tasks to complete."]},{"l":"Design","p":["Design is our sub-team responsible for 3d modelling our parts, running the 3d printer and running simulations of the robot. You should not approach their enclosure without pizza or energy drinks. They are a subgenus of the Code genus.

Electrical and Build are often seen togather, as they have a symbiotic relationship. They like to play with electricity and watching the news for shocking developments.

Often seen in their natural habitat surrounded by tools and metal. They communicate through a series of grunts and metal screeching sounds.

Often seen working with Undertale of Legend of Zelda music in the background and communicating through beeps and robotic screeching. Do not enter their workspace without energy drinks and sugar.
