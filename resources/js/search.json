[[{"i":"welcome-to-the-4733-frc-wiki","l":"Welcome to the 4733 FRC Wiki!","p":["Welcome to the 4733 Scarlett Robotics Team wiki. Our group is made up of 4 sub-teams: Design, Electrical, Build and Code. In each sub-team you will learn various skills and methods to design, build, wire and code. Each sub-team has specific roles and tasks to complete."]},{"l":"Design","p":["Design is our sub-team responsible for 3d modelling our parts, running the 3d printer and running simulations of the robot. You should not approach their enclosure without pizza or energy drinks. They are a subgenus of the Code genus."]},{"l":"Electrical","p":["Electrical has the task of wiring and repairing the electrical and pneumatic systems. Electrical and Build are often seen togather, as they have a symbiotic relationship. They like to play with electricity and watching the news for shocking developments."]},{"l":"Build","p":["Build team assumes the role of the constructors of the team. They build the robots frame and various subsystems. Often seen in their natural habitat surrounded by tools and metal. They communicate through a series of grunts and metal screeching sounds."]},{"l":"Code","p":["The Code sub-team are entrusted with making the robot have a brain. Often seen working with Undertale of Legend of Zelda music in the background and communicating through beeps and robotic screeching. Do not enter their workspace without energy drinks and sugar."]}],[{"l":"Code","p":["The code team is an integral part to the team. As a member of code team, you will be required to:","Write code for the robot in Java","Help develop ideas for the robot","Communicate with Build, Electrical, Design, and Drive Team when making decitions","Test the code written to find bugs and issues","Implement fixes to any problems that occur along the way","The code used for the robot uses more advanced Java features (such as Object-Oriented Programming), which is not taught in CS until Computer Science 30.","Members on code team are expected to be able to bring in their own laptop to use for code. While the team does have two laptops availible, they may be used by other subteam (such as Design)."]}],[{"l":"Software","p":["Multiple pieces of software are required to program the robot. While not every piece of software is required, having it will make your life easier.","Please note that some of the software is updated every season. Please make sure the software you are using is up to date. Using an older version may go against the rules of the FRC competition.","WPILib VSCode","WPILib VSCode is a version of the Visual Studio Code text editor with pre-installed required extensions.","Github Desktop","Github Desktop is a desktop application that allows you to create and manage repositories on Github. VSCode has a git client built in, but Github Desktop has additional features that may come in useful.","Git Bash","Git Bash is a terminal application that allows you to interact with Git. VSCode has a built in terminal, however, having a bash terminal installed on your system outside VSCode can come in handy.","Pheonix Tuner","Pheonix Tuner is a program that allows you to interact with CTRE motor controllers and set up the CAN bus. It is highly recommened at least one person on the team has this installed.","RoboRIO Imaging Tool","RoboRIO Imaging Tool is a program that allows you to manage the firmware on the RoboRIO. It is highly recommened at least one person on the team has this installed.","FRC Radio Configuration Utility","FRC Radio Configuration Utility is a program that allows you to manage the radio configuration. It is highly recommened at least one person on the team has this installed."]}],[{"l":"Creating a Project"}],[{"l":"Design"}],[{"l":"3D Printer","p":["All 3d print files must be in stl format and brought to a senior to be sliced and printed","Personal prints will cost 10Â¢ per meter of filament used","Failure to coply with these rule will result in loss of 3d printer privileges"]},{"l":"Finding a file to print and slicing","p":["Ensure the file is stl. Import the file into a slicer along with any other files you would like to print. The preferred slicer for the Monoprice printer is IIIP Cura a python based Cura version. If any other 3d printers have been obtained use Prusa3d slicer."]},{"l":"Ensuring printer is prepared for printing","p":["Bed Temp (C): 50","Bottom/Top thickness (mm): 0.6","Brim for less expansive prints.","Diameter (mm): Change as Needed","Distance (mm): 7","Enable Retraction: yes","Everywhere if overhang above model","Fill Density (%): 90","Flow (%): 100.0","Initial Layer Line Width (%): 100.0","Initial Layer Thickness: 0.3","Layer Height (mm): 0.1","Nozzle size (mm): 0.4","Platform Adhesion type:","Please make sure the following settings are set in the IIIP Cura software:","Print Speed (mm/s): 50","Printing Temp (C): 195","Raft for large and sensitive prints.","Shell Thickness (mm): 1.2","Speed (mm/s): 40.0","Support Type: Change as needed.","Touching buildplate if no overhang above model."]}],[{"l":"Build"}],[{"l":"Electrical"}]]
