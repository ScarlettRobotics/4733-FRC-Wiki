Git allows for multiple developers to simultaniously work on a project without overwriting other people's work. Git has been used for many years as what is called a 'version control' system, and has made group development work much easier. If you decide to persue a job in development, there is a high likelyhood that you will be using Git in some form."]},{"i":"what-is-github","l":"What is GitHub?","p":["GitHub is a website that hosts Git projects called 'repositories' or 'repos', and they add numerous additions that help GitHub be used with the internet so developers can work anywhere. We will be using GitHub and by extention Git extensively during robotics, and most likely through out your development career. You can think of GitHub as being a 'devloper Google Docs' of sorts evwen though they are structured much differently."]},{"i":"well-how-do-i-git-understand-git","l":"Well how do I 'git' (understand) git?","p":["Git may seem confusing at first, but in no time you will be a pro. You do not need to use a confusing command line or type a bunch of code (unless you would like to, of course), as you can use GitHub Desktop (link needed), or the tools built into your coding software of choice. We will be showing instructions for GitHub Desktop and other graphical tools, but you are welcome to find resources for the command line interface if you would like."]}],[{"l":"Tips"}],[{"l":"Assignment"}],[{"l":"Installation"},{"l":"Installing GitHub Desktop"}],[{"l":"Tutorial"}]]
