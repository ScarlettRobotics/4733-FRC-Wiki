There may be issues with the current content, or may be missing important details.","Welcome to the 20718 Lancer Robotics Team wiki. Our group is made up of 4 sub-teams: Design, Electrical, Build and Code. In each sub-team you will learn various skills and methods to design, build, wire and code. Each sub-team has specific roles and tasks to complete."]},{"l":"Build","p":["Build team assumes the role of the constructors of the team. They build the robots frame and various subsystems. Often seen in their natural habitat surrounded by tools and metal. They communicate through a series of grunts and metal screeching sounds."]},{"l":"Code","p":["The Code sub-team are entrusted with making the robot have a brain. Often seen working with Undertale of Legend of Zelda music in the background and communicating through beeps and robotic screeching. Do not enter their workspace without energy drinks and sugar."]},{"l":"Design","p":["Design is our sub-team responsible for 3d modelling our parts, running the 3d printer and running simulations of the robot. You should not approach their enclosure without pizza or energy drinks. They are a subgenus of the Code genus."]},{"l":"Electrical","p":["Electrical has the task of wiring and repairing the electrical and pneumatic systems. Electrical and Build are often seen together, as they have a symbiotic relationship. They like to play with electricity and watching the news for shocking developments."]}],[{"l":"Build","p":["The build team is an integral part to the team. As a member of build team, you will be required to:","Work with tools, materials, and other parts to build the robot","Help develop ideas for the robot","Communicate with Code, Electrical, and Design when making decisions","Work closely with Design team to ensure any designs work on the physical robot.","Many of your responsibilities overlap with the Electrical team's responsibilities. Cooperation among team members is crucial to the success of the team.","Because power tools and other dangerous equipment is used while building the robot, safety is a top priority. Horseplay is strictly forbidden."]}],[{"l":"Code","p":["The code team is an integral part to the team. As a member of code team, you will be required to:","Write code for the robot in Java","Help develop ideas for the robot","Communicate with Build, Electrical, Design, and Drive Team when making decisions","Test the code written to find bugs and issues","Implement fixes to any problems that occur along the way","The code used for the robot uses more advanced Java features (such as Object-Oriented Programming), which is not taught in CS until Computer Science 30.","Members on code team are expected to be able to bring in their own laptop to use for code. While the team does have two laptops available, they may be used by another sub-team (such as Design)."]}],[{"l":"Design","p":["The design team is an integral part to the team. As a member of design team, you will be required to:","Use 3D-modeling software to design the robot.","Use 3D-modeling software to design parts for the robot.","Become familiar with the 3D printer.","Work closely with Build team and Electrical team to ensure any designs work on the physical robot.","The design team is crucial to the success of the team. Designs are used to test ideas before they are implemented, allowing for rapid prototyping."]}],[{"l":"Electrical","p":["The electrical team is an integral part to the team. As a member of the electrical team, you will be required to:","Wire the robot's electrical components","Fix electrical issues","Communicate with Build, Code, and Design when making decisions","Inform code team with the types of motors used, an the ports they are plugged into.","Safety is a top priority with electrical. Strict guidelines must be in place to prevent electrical issues, including shocks and fires."]}]]
